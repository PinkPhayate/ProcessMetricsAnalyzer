/**
Twinkle,twinkle,little star!
How I wonder what you are!
Up,above the world,so high,
Like a diamond in the sky.
Twinkle,twinkle,little star!
How I wonder what you are! */

//When the blazzing sun is set,
//When the grass with dew is wet,
//Then you show your little light,
//Twinkle,twinkle,all the night.
Twinkle,twinkle,little star!
How I wonder what you are!
